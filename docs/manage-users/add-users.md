# Invite people to your program

## Things to keep in mind
- If you add someone to a program and they don't have an account yet, they'll receive an email with instructions to create one.
- Users will only have access to programs they're added to, not an entire organization.
 
## Add people to a program

1. Open the program you'd like to add someone to.
2. Click **User Management** in the top right dropdown.
